<h1>ContactManagerApplication</h1>
<h3>About:</h3>
This is a learning Project, the main Objective of this project to create an application which stores contacts in very efficient way and it provides a smarter way of handling contacts with fully Authentication and Authorization.

<h3>Use Case:</h3>
If a user lost his phone,then also user can visit this website and access all of his contacts..


<h3>Tool used:</h3>
Spring Boot is used to develop back-end and Spring Data JPA is used for performing Database CRUD operations.
<br>
HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap ,Thymeleaf and JQuery as template Engine is used to develop the front end..
<br>
I have created this project using Spring Boot,Thymeleaf,Hibernate,JPA with MVC Architecture and for Authentication and Authorization I have used Spring Security.

<h3>Working:</h3>
Here I have used server side validation for validating username ,password ,email etc.For validating the email I have used regex expressions.Used BCryptPasswordEncoder to encode the password,so that it will not be visible in normal form.
<br>
Here I have used Spring Security,so that any malicious call to my endpoint will not be authenticated..
<br>
There is various module after successful login,user can see his profile,Edit profile,Add Contacts,Delete Contacts,Update contacts etc.
